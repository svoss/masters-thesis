### Mid february - 9 April:
Project setup and proposal. First worked on [image recognition](doc/proposal/image-recognition.pdf). After I found that this probably wasn't going to be very valueable just by it self.
I moved to a more [NLP based approach](doc/proposal/nlp.pdf)

### 10 April - 16 April:
Addressing the two largest challenges/gray areas/unknowns that I suspect based on my proposal:
- The loss function: My network will be a Multi-Task network, predicting different attributes of a network but not all of them will always be defined.
- Determining an architecture on a smaller dataset to get an idea what will work and what won't and what kind of computational resources we should think of

### 17 April - 23 April:
Hope to be able to obtain my dataset
